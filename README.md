<b>Survey Design:</b> The survey is designed in Excel, a widely accessible and user-friendly spreadsheet software. Excel provides a familiar interface for participants to input their responses, making it easier to gather data from a diverse group of respondents.

<b>Dashboard Creation:</b> The dashboard is a visual representation of the survey data, presenting key metrics and trends in a clear and concise manner.

<b>Data Visualization:</b> Excel's charting and graphing capabilities are utilized to create various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and histograms. These visuals help in presenting the income distribution, average income, income categories, and other relevant insights.
